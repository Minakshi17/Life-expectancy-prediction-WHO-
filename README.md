# Life-expectancy-prediction-WHO-
Statistical Analysis on factors influencing Life Expectancy

# Project Objective: To predicts life expectancy of an individual by observing  the Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors which impacts life expectancy

# Data Description:
Dataset feature: Shape of dataset :- (2938,22)
![Alt text](/relative/path/to/who_data_description.PNG?raw=true "Optional Title")

# Data Cleaning:
The data was checked for missing and Duplicate values. 
- Replace NaN in each column with the respective column Median
- Renamed some column names as they contain trailing spaces e.g. Who_df.rename(columns={" BMI ":"BMI", },inplace=True)
- Mapped 'Developing':0,'Developed':1 in Column 'Status’
- Dropped  column ‘country’ as it has 193 unique value
- Dropped  column 'Under_Five_Deaths','thinness_5to9_years','Percentage_Exp

# Feature Engineering
Used Standard Scaling to normalise data

# Evaluation Metrics for Regression
For Regression tasks, the best model is evaluated on the basis of r2 Square score followed by least Root Mean Squared error (RMSE) followed by Train and Test Scores

# Model
## Build almost 24 model
